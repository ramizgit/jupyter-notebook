Pandas is a very useful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides high-performant, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for working with structured data, including tabular, time-series, and matrix data. The core data structure in Pandas is the Dataframe which can be thought as tables in a relational database where each column can have a different data type. Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called Series, which can be thought of as a single column with row labels of a Dataframe.
